Light Attenuation in the CCE: Deriving Water Clarity from PAR, Secchi Depth and Satellite Data

This Capstone Project would investigate the relationship between in situ photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor readings and Secchi depth measurements across various domains of the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). The central goal is to develop and validate a model that can accurately estimate Secchi depth from PAR data, which would ultimately justify a reduction in traditional Secchi disk deployments. By establishing a predictive relationship, the project aims to create a more efficient and continuous method for monitoring water clarity. Additionally, the project will explore the correlation between the PAR-derived diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kpar) and satellite-derived diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd(490)) products, thereby bridging ship-based observations with large-scale remote sensing data.

This project holds significant relevance for several reasons. From an operational standpoint, it offers a practical solution to a long-standing logistical challenge by proposing a way to reduce labor-intensive Secchi depth measurements without compromising data quality. It would help bridge the gap between historical Secchi ocean depth measurements which most oceanographic programs and projects no longer uses. This would free up valuable ship time and resources on the CalCOFI programs seasonal monitoring cruises for other research objectives. Scientifically, the study addresses a notable gap in the literature, as very few studies have specifically examined the relationship between in situ PAR and satellite Kd(490) products in the unique, highly-sampled CCE, or indeed in most of the worlds oceans. The long-term CalCOFI dataset available for the CCE provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a robust and publishable study that would advance our understanding of light attenuation in this important marine ecosystem. By linking in situ and remote sensing products, the project provides a more comprehensive tool for monitoring changes in water clarity and ecosystem health over time and across vast spatial scales.
